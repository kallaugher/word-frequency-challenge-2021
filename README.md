Instructions: 

- What words or phrases appear more frequently in questions that students tend to do poorly on, and what appear more frequently in questions that students do well on?

- We think this exercise should take about one hour. Please do not spend more than three hours working on it. Include a brief write-up of your solution and results in the body of your reply. You may respond to this email with questions.

- Python or JavaScript are fundamental competencies at Newsela. We suggest code be written in one of these languages, but it is not a requirement. Reference any dependencies using a standard format. We should be able to get the code running ourselves.

- There's no one right answer here, but there are more or less meaningful results. Well-documented code is a plus but not necessary. Our expectation is that we can follow your thought process. If you get different results using different methods you may include any that you find interesting in your response.

Hints:

- It's acceptable to define "questions students did poorly/well on" as questions with percent correct values of less than 50% or greater than 50%, respectively. There may be other approaches or cutoff values that yield different results.

- Consider how many appearances of a word there needs to be in order to say something about it. There may be words that should be excluded or sanitized.
